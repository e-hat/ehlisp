## About/Roadmap
- [x] ~~I am currently translating [this tutorial](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/lisp/00_fundamentals/) 
into rust.~~ I'm all done! I've got a working lisp interpr`eter! 
- [X] I'm doing garbage collection now! 
- [ ] Now I wanna try to make the garbage collection a little multithreaded. Hopefully it boosts performance.
- [ ] Not sure what's next!

This is also my first ever time using rust! I am currently loving it. I can't believe I survive in C++ without pattern
matching, which has been amazing for traversing the ASTs and S-expressions. Also, programming in rust has made me 
think a lot more about the memory lifetimes in my program, which is fun and has already made me better at C++.

## Pronunciation
"eh-lisp", like "Eh", followed by "lisp"
