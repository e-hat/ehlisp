# ehlisp

## Pronunciation
I'm not really sure. Maybe like an incorrect pronunciation of "ellipse", like "ellisp"? Also maybe 
like "a lisp". I named it this because I think it's funny to name all of my projects 
to be some variant of my name or initials. I probably should've gone with `hatlisp`
but I don't want to change it at this point.

## About
I am currently translating [this tutorial](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/lisp/00_fundamentals/) 
into rust. Then I will try to make the result faster, probably using some profiling tools.

Then I want to make it use a JIT compiler with LLVM possibly? I still have to look into this. 
Maybe I'll end up spending a lot of time doing non-JIT optimizations.

This is also my first ever time using rust so don't hate on it. I already miss 
being in C++ where I was allowed to be wrong 😓
