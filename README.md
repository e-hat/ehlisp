## About/Roadmap
- [x] ~~I am currently translating [this tutorial](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/lisp/00_fundamentals/) 
into rust.~~ I've got a working lisp interpreter! 
- [X] ~~Garbage collection~~ There now is a working garbage collector!
- [ ] I want to improve garbage collection by either deciding when it happens more effectively or parallelizing some of it, possibly both.
- [ ] Not sure what's next!

This is also my first ever time using rust! I am currently loving it. I can't believe I survive in C++ without pattern
matching, which has been amazing for traversing the ASTs and S-expressions. Also, programming in rust has made me 
think a lot more about the memory lifetimes in my program, which is fun and has already made me better at C++.

## Pronunciation
"eh-lisp", like "Eh", followed by "lisp"
